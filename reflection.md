- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
  My class is representing a troll, which interacts with human items. It has two parameters to receive at the first place, name and height. They can grab or drop the humans. When humans are in their hand, they can use them up, ultimately killing them.. The examine method returns the item itself. Trolls cannot walk, because they do not have legs, as they're rocks. However, they can fly by teleportation magic. The height can be shrunk or grown. The troll can go to sleep by rest method, yet they cannot wake up easily!
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
  I had helper method which checks if the troll is awake, because if it's asleep it cannot do any actions. Also, I had printAll method which prints the items list in its hand.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
  All of my codes worked, and I would give an advice to actually organize the methods and attributes you would have before starting on, as otherwise you might be spending more time on re-editing later.
